## Executive Summary

I have successfully developed and deployed a comprehensive automated client-side script monitoring and alerting system that directly addresses PCI DSS v4.0.1 requirements 6.4.3 and 11.6.1. This solution provides real-time protection against client-side attacks including Magecart skimmers, formjacking, and unauthorized script modifications.

## Key Achievements

### ✅ PCI DSS Compliance
- **Requirement 6.4.3**: Complete script management for payment pages
- **Requirement 11.6.1**: Real-time detection and alerting of unauthorized modifications
- Goes beyond checkbox compliance with practical, deployable security measures

### ✅ Real-World Threat Protection
- Detects Magecart-style skimmer injections
- Identifies formjacking overlay attacks
- Monitors unauthorized script loading from malicious domains
- Tracks DOM manipulation attempts on payment forms

### ✅ Production-Ready Implementation
- Scalable Flask backend with PostgreSQL database
- Lightweight JavaScript monitoring agents
- Professional React dashboard interface
- Comprehensive API for integration
